# odin-recipes
My first practice repo!

In this section we put together the knowledge we have acquired and translate it into practice. 
In this project we are going to build a website for a very simple recipe. The website consists of a main-index page which will present a series of links to some recipes. We will not dwell much on the style of the page (this is something we will think about later). 
Let us rather think about consolidating HTML skills. 
- First, let us set up a new repository 
- Next, we edit the file README.md (which is the file we are editing now)
